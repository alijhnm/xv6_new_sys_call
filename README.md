### Question 1

Here we try to create a basic `system-call` that can be used when you try to implement your scheduler functions. 

The first step is to `extend` the current `proc structure` and add new fields `ctime`, `etime` and `rtime` for
creation time, end-time and total time respectively of a process. When a new process gets created the kernel code should update the process creation time. The run-time should get updated after `every clock tick` for
the process. To extract this information from the kernel add a new system call which `extends` `wait`. The new call will be

`int waitx(int *wtime, int *rtime)`

The two arguments are pointers to integers to which waitx will assign the total number of clock ticks during which process was waiting and total number of clock ticks when the process was running. The return values for waitx should be same as that of wait system-call. 

Create a test program which utilises the waitx system-call by creating a
`time` like command for the same.

The new waitx call has been implemented mainly by changing the proc structure and trap call.

New variables called stime (Start time), etime (End time), rtime (Run time), and iotime (I/O time) has been added. Now the stime gets updated when the command is first scheduled on the CPU. End time is called when the program exits. Run time is calculated by appropiately calculating the stime, etime and the iotime (which is when the process is sleeping and I/O is going on). 

Time is counted in each of these variables using ticks.

### Question 2 - To Be Done

Now that you know how to add system-calls to Xv6, lets extend the idea. `Replace` the `current` `round robin scheduler` for Xv6 and replace it with a `priority based scheduler`. A priority based scheduler selects the process
with highest priority for execution. In case two or more processes have same priority, we choose them in a round robin fashion. The `priority` of a process can be in the `range [0,100]`, smaller value will represent higher priority. Set the `default priority` of a process as `60`. To change the default priority add a new `system-call` `set_priority` which can change the priority of a process.

`int set_priority(int)`

The system-call returns the old-priority value of the process. In case the the priority of the process increases (the value is lower than before), then rescheduling should be done.

***Hint :*** Think along the lines of using `yield` system call. 

Make a report which includes a small example and a comparison of your current (priority based) scheduling policy and round robin approach.

### Question 3 - To Be Done

- Implement a `lottery based scheduler` for Xv6. The idea 	behind a lottery based scheduler is simple : Assign 	each running process a slice of the processor based in 	proportion to the `number of tickets` it has; the more
	tickets a process has, the more it runs. Each time slice, a randomized lottery determines the winner of the lottery; that winning process is the one that runs for that time slice. For this the following system call:

	`int settickets(int num)` 

	which sets the number of tickets of the calling process. By default, each process should get one ticket; calling this routine makes it such that a process can raise the number of tickets it receives, and thus receive a higher proportion of CPU cycles. This routine should return `0 if successful`, and `-1 otherwise` (if, for example,the user passes in a number less than one).

	***Output :***
	Output the results in a graph like format for two process, where `numtickets(process_1)=4*numtickets(process_2)`
	Indicating number of time-slices a set of two process receive over time.

***OR***

- Implement a `Multi-Level Queue Scheduling` which will 	have `3 queues`:
	- ***First Queue :*** The first queue will hold the `high priority` processes. The processes in this queue will be scheduled according to the guaranteed scheduling policy (Implement any `fair scheduling policy` of your choice).
	- ***Second Queue :*** The second queue will hold `medium priority` processes. The processes in this queue will be scheduled according to the `FIFO round robin scheduling policy`.
	- ***Third Queue :*** The third queue will hold `low priority` processes. The processes in this queue will be scheduled according to the `round robin scheduling policy`.
	
	A process with a higher priority will be preferred and run before a process with a lower priority. Add a sys-call 

	`nice()`

	which can `decrease the priority` of a process ( returns `0 on success` , `else -1` ) and can be used to demonstrate the results.

	***Hint:*** Modify the proc structure for storing the priority of every process.

	***Output :*** Output the results in the form of a report for a small example which demonstrates the correct working of the scheduler. Utilise the output of `waitx` system-call, and report the average turn-around time for each of the process.

### General Comments:

1. In order to test your scheduler, try to create small code examples which forks a new process and assigns a unique number to each process created. For every process with say `unique_id % 3 == x` (can have some
value) , do a I/O intensive job, or decrement the nice value , or increase the priority. The type of jobs that you decide to do in each process should be fairly simple so that you can easily derive conclusions from them.
2. In order to debug the kernel - Try the following link <http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs422/2011/lec/l2-hw> and use `make qemu-gdb` and `gdb kernel` commands to start debugging. Set breakpoints in your gdb and to run the code type `c` or `continue` in your gdb.
3. Whenever you add new files do not forget to add them to the `Makefile` so that they get included in the build.
